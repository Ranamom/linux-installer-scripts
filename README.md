Linux desktop and server installation &amp; configuration scripts

1. `install-plasma.sh` Bash Script to Install KDE Plasma from Backports Extra on Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS

- Purpose is to create a functional *desktop* with the latest KDE Plasma (like KDE Neon) starting from a "minimal" iso (similar to Debian netinst), which happens to be the Server ISO, as other minimal Ubuntu ISOs with an installer have been discontinued. The purpose is *not* to run this as a server.
